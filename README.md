# EEG Artifact Rejection

The Juyter notebook(s) and script(s) in the EEG-artifact-rejection are prototypes for a more automated process in detecting and rejecting EEG artifacts.

## Usage

This ongoing process explores the efficacy of using an Isolation Forest (supervised) to detect artifacts in EEG data and possibly other time series.
